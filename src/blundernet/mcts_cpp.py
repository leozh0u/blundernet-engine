"""Batched MCTS driver over the C++ tree core (blundercore).

The C++ side owns the tree and PUCT selection with virtual loss; this side
owns chess rules and the network. Each iteration asks the tree for a batch
of leaves, replays their move paths on board copies, and evaluates all of
them through the net in ONE forward pass — that batching, not the C++ per
se, is where most of the end-to-end speedup comes from.
